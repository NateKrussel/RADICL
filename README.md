RADICL
======

RADICL web page, will be used as the web server


This will be the base code for the web server that will be used to deploy experiments to the VMware environment for our lab. 
This will be free for anybody to clone and make use of in their own environment, but may take some tweaking to get it to work with your individual environment.
Some bugs will be expected, feel free to mark them. 

This is for my masters degree 2014, and may or may not be touched afterwards to support more features.
